Star-Spangled is a react component library. You can use it to create interactive web pages that allow writers to insert reactive elements with which the reader can interact to understand the underlying model better.

Inspired by [Brett Victor's Tangled library](http://worrydream.com/Tangle/) and is written from scratch in react to make it usable for the component age.

You can see a [demo](https://pradeeproark.github.io/star-spangled/) of the components in storybook format.
